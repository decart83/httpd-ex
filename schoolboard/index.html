								<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
							</header>

<h3>How many years have you been on the school board?</h3>

<p>I am in the process of completing my first full term which means I have been on the school board for four years.</p>							

<h3>Why are you running for a seat on the school board?</h3>

<p>I truly relish the experience of learning which is fortunate because we spend every moment of our life learning. A goal of mine is to instill the love of learning in my children. Education is the one thing that seems to have a high potential to improve the future of my children's lives. I do not just mean this monetarily. I want to help build a future where my children's generation flourishes and my children are proud to work with their peers to improve the world we created for them. If elected, I plan to continue helping my peers on the board of eduction create a safe place to learn for many generations to come.</p>      

<h3>How long have you lived in the district?</h3>

<p>My wife and three children have lived in Skokie for nine years. Well, except for Harrison, he was born 5 years ago. </p> 
 
<h3>Do you have kids in any of the district schools?</h3>

<p>Yep, all of them. Harrison is a proud preschooler at Meyer. Bailey attends Middleton and is in fourth grade. Sophia technically is in seventh grade at McCracken but she feels more like an adult every day.</p> 

<h3>How have you personally been involved in the district up to now?</h3>

<p>Besides serving on the school board, I was a parent leader on the SD 73.5 MTSS committee. It was a great pleasure for me to work with Amber Brydon and my fellow parents to improve the already impressive MTSS program. You can see the video that we produced as a team. However, the thing that I am the proudest of is teaching beside our great educators in the district. Your child might have been in one of the classes where we launched rockets, programmed humans like robots, studied cryptography, raced across the room with different units of measure, found mathematical objects in nature, or learned that the stories of our lives can be analyzed quantitatively.</p>

<h3>What do you do? </h3>
    
<p>I lead a group of learning engineers that are located all over the world. We build adaptive learning experiences that are used by a wide variety of people in various industries. Trust me, it is even more fun than it sounds. We support learners from all walks of life. Just to name a few, the products that we create improve the lives of students across all grade levels, business leaders learning leadership skills, doctors refreshing their medical knowledge, or corporations looking to onboard new employees quickly.</p>
